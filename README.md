# EarnestProject

I have uploaded the Maven project containing Automated test cases in src/test/java/page/tests, you will find TestOrderPage.java. Just run as a TestNG test or use 'mvn test' command from the commandline. It will run all tests to confirm pricing, state tarriffs and also test for invalid input. Thank you for the opportunity.
